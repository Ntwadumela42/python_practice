'''
The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
Note: 27.7779 * km/h = cm/s

import math
def cockroach_speed(s):
    return (math.floor(s * 27.77777778))
